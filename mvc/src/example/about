MVC architectural pattern follows an elementary idea â€“ we must separate the responsibilities in any application on the following basis:

Model: Handles data and business logic.
View: Presents the data to the user whenever asked for.
Controller: Entertains user requests and fetch necessary resources.


A Simple Implementation of MVC using Java
We will have the following three:

StudentObject : the model.
StudentView: view class to print details on the console.
StudentController: a controller that stores data in studentObject and updates StudentView accordingly
