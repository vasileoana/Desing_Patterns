MVC
All input coming from user interaction,
such mouse click. are directed to the
Controller first.
The Controller then kick off some functionality.
 A single Controller may render many different
 Views based on the operation being executed.
 Also view doesnâ€™t have any knowledge of or reference to
 the Controller. Controller interact with
 the Model and pass the model to the View. So there
is a knowledge between the View and Model  being passed on to it.
